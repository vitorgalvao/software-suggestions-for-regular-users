# Software suggestions for regular users

I’m often asked for software recommendations. In maintaining [`homebrew-cask`](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/) I’m in frequent contact with new apps, but that does not mean I use them. Yet, some I decide to save for later as they look like they would make fine recommendations. This is where I save them to.

[Suggestions](#suggestions) is the main interest point. I haven’t used the majority of software on that list; they’re recommended on the basis of their perceived usefulness or third-party praise. They’re all free to use, as most people I know don’t pay for apps.

An [alternatives](#alternatives) list is also included. You’ll know an app has an alternative by the asterisk next to its name. Unlike with the suggestions list, the alternatives are all software I currently use or used heavily in the past. They’re considered alternatives because they’re either paid or too advanced for most users (command-line apps, for example).
